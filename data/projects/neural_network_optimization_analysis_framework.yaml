source_text: I developed a comprehensive Neural Network Optimization Analysis Framework
  for analyzing, optimizing, and deploying neural networks across multiple datasets
  with focus on edge device compatibility and performance profiling. The framework
  provides a complete pipeline for training neural networks on 10+ datasets with different
  activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh), implementing structural pruning to reduce
  model complexity while maintaining accuracy, ONNX export for cross-platform deployment,
  Edge Impulse profiling for embedded device compatibility, and Arduino deployment
  with optimized C++ implementations. Key features include multi-activation analysis
  comparing ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh activations with automated batch processing, correlation-based
  neuron pruning with activity and sensitivity analysis, edge device optimization
  with ONNX model export and Edge Impulse integration, comprehensive analysis including
  model architecture analysis, parameter counting, inference time profiling, and LLM-powered
  insights. The system supports datasets including Iris, Breast Cancer, Credit Card,
  Balance, Customers, Fetal Health, Liver Diagnostic, Raisin, and Yeast across various
  domains like medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and agricultural analysis. The
  framework includes automated end-to-end processing from training to deployment with
  bulk processing capabilities, result consolidation, and comprehensive reporting.
