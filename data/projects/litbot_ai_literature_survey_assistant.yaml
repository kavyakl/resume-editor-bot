title: 'LitBot: AI Literature Survey Assistant'
description: LitBot is an AI-powered literature survey assistant developed to help
  researchers efficiently manage and analyze academic papers. The system provides
  intelligent paper search, summarization, citation management, and advanced relationship
  analysis with sophisticated AI/ML-specific preprocessing, semantic chunking, and
  reference mapping capabilities.
role: Developer

  automatic metadata extraction, AI-generated paper summaries with structured output
  for methodology, datasets, and results, comprehensive reference mapping with section-based
  citation analysis, enhanced relationship analysis including direct citations, co-citations,
  and bibliographic coupling, and batch processing automation for entire libraries.
  The system uses OpenAI GPT models for summarization, FAISS for vector search, PyMuPDF
  for PDF processing, and NLTK for text chunking. It processes papers to extract detailed
  information including paper type, key findings, methodology, datasets, model architectures,
  main results, limitations, and practical implications. The project includes a comprehensive
  data management system with JSON storage, efficient caching, and robust error handling.'
