source_text: I developed a distributed framework for real-time object detection at
  low frame rates with IoT edge nodes, published at IEEE iSES 2020. The framework
  addresses the need for real-time computer vision applications in IoT and Edge Computing
  domains by implementing neural networks on constrained platforms. I employed PYNQ
  Z1 AP-SoC (All Programmable System-on-Chip) as the IoT edge node platform and integrated
  state-of-the-art algorithms for object detection. The distributed architecture exploits
  the heterogeneous computing capability of the PYNQ platform and operates on a wireless
  distributed network with minimal communication latency. The framework is designed
  for low frame rate applications where scenery is not changing rapidly. Key achievements
  include achieving 19.23 frames per second with three IoT nodes using Binarized Neural
  Network (BNN) image classification algorithm, with frame rate directly proportional
  to the number of nodes in the network. The communication latency is offset by the
  scalability offered by the distributed framework. This work demonstrates practical
  implementation of neural networks in complex IoT environments with real-time performance
  requirements.
